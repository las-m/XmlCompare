# XmlCompare
Compares variables and channels of .ctr files from ExpControl. Shows results in MatLab Gui. Mostly written in MatLab. The 
parsing of the Xml and some processing of it is done by pythonmodules. 
I assume that your python32 folder is in the directory C:\Python32. You can change this in python.m
You need to install scipy ansd numpy
The python Files must be in a folder called Pythonscripts that is in your MatLab working directory.

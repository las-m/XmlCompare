# XmlCompare
Compares variables and channels of .ctr files from ExpControl. Shows results in MatLab Gui. Mostly written in MatLab; The 
parsing of the Xml and some processing of it is done by pythonmodules. 
I assume that your python32 folder is in the directory C:\Python32. You can change this in python.m
You need to install scipy ansd numpy
The python Files must be in a folder called Pythonscripts that is in the same directory as the other files.
